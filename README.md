# 10 Days of JavaScript Projects 🚀

Welcome to the "10 Days of JavaScript" series! In this series, I'll be sharing a new JavaScript project every day for the next 10 days. Each project is designed to help you improve your JavaScript skills and explore various aspects of web development. 🌟

## What to Expect 📅
- **Daily Projects**: I'll be uploading a new project every day, each with a unique focus and set of features.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: All projects are built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, so you can learn and practice core web development concepts. 🍦
- **Folder Structure**: Each project is organized in its own folder, named according to the project number (e.g., `01_Project_CountDown_Timer`). 📂

## Getting the Source Code 📦

You can easily access the source code for each project:

 1. Navigate to the project folder you're interested in.
 2. Find the `README.md` file within each project folder for a detailed explanation of the project and how it works.
 3. Clone or download the entire repository to access all projects in one place. 📥
